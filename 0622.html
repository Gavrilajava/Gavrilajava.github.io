    <title>Pragmatic intro to React part 1 — Basics</title>

      In the last article I was talking about React basics such as Virtual DOM and JSX Another distinctive feature of the library is its concentration on components — we can create individual components and then easily transfer them from project to project or use them several times inside the project.
      In order to better understand the following, I suggest you make sure that you have everything installed here and create a simple React application using the command:
      npm create-react-app [your-name]
      or:
      npx create-react-app [your-name]
      The difference between the commands is that npm takes the current version of the package you have installed, and npx downloads the latest one. I use npx. You can also just copy my code from here.
      So, let’s have a look at the /src/app.js file:

      The easiest way to create a React component is to create a class that is an heir to React.Component. This is the task solved by the class string App extends Component. All React class components must contain an implementation of the render method, which, as can be guessed from its name, renders the component and forms its visual representation description. This method should return HTML markup to display it on a page. Note that a className attribute is the equivalent of a class attribute in HTML. It is used to assign elements of CSS classes for styling purposes. The keyword class in JavaScript is reserved, it cannot be used as an attribute name.
      Now let’s take a look at the /src/index.js file, which is the entry point to our application. It has only two lines and both are essential for our application. The first one:

      Responsible for placing the root component of our application in a template, which is located in the /public folder called index.html. The function accepts two arguments, the first is the actual component and the second is the real DOM element in which this component should be placed. The second line:

      is responsible for creating the Service Worker. “the script that the browser runs in the background, separately from the page, opening the door for features that do not require a web page or user interaction. Today they perform such functions as push notifications and background synchronization, in the future SW will support other things. Their key feature is the ability to intercept and process network requests, including software caching management of responses. Service Worker runs in a worker context, so it does not have access to DOM and runs in a thread separate from the main JavaScript stream that controls your application and therefore does not block it. How to customize it is a topic for a separate article.
      Now let’s have a look at the /public folder where our template is located as well as the files available to the user. Besides the template, there are icon files, robots.txt and manifest.json. If you put frequently used styles and pictures here, the user’s browsers will be able to cache them and your application will load faster. Let’s have a look at index.html:

      As you can see, there are a lot of comments created by the generator, a disclaimer in case the user does not have javascript, and the only div in which our application will be drawn.
      That’s all for now, next time we will see how to create a working build.
