    <title>What is Agile, Scrum and Kanban</title>

      Agile is a family of “flexible” approaches to software development. Such approaches are also sometimes called frameworks or agile-methodologies. Agile emerged in the IT environment, but then spread to other areas — from industrial engineering to artificial intelligence.

The meaning of Agile is formulated in the Agile Software Development Manifesto: “People and interaction are more important than processes and tools. A working product is more important than comprehensive documentation. Collaboration with the customer is more important than negotiating the terms of the contract. Preparedness for changes is more important than following the original plan. Agile assumes that you don’t need to rely only on pre-created detailed plans when implementing a project. It is important to focus on the ever-changing external and internal environment and take into account feedback from customers and users. This encourages developers and engineers to experiment and look for new solutions without limiting themselves to rigid frameworks and standards. Individual agile approaches include scrum and kanban.

Scrum is a “structure approach”. A universal team of specialists works on each project and two more people join it: the owner of the product and the scrum master. The first one connects the team with the customer and monitors the project development; this is not a formal team leader but rather a curator. The second one helps the first to organize the business process: holds general meetings, solves household problems, motivates the team and monitors compliance with the scrum approach.
The Scrum Approach divides the workflow into equal sprints — usually periods from a week to a month, depending on the project and the team. Before the sprint, tasks are formulated for that sprint, at the end, the results are discussed and the team starts a new sprint. It is very convenient to compare sprints with each other, which allows you to manage the efficiency of work.

Kanban is a “balance approach”. Its task is to balance different specialists within the team and to avoid situations when designers work 24 hours a day and developers complain about the lack of new tasks. The whole team is united — there are no roles of product owner and scrum-master in Kanban. The business process is not divided into universal sprints, but at the stage of performing specific tasks: “Planned”, “In Progress”, “Tested”, “Completed”, etc. The business process is not divided into universal sprints. The main performance indicator in kanban is the average time of passing the task on the board. The task passed quickly — the team worked productively and harmoniously. The task took a long time — one should think at what stage and why there were delays and whose work should be optimized.
To visualize agile approaches, boards are used: physical and electronic. They allow making the work process open and understandable for all specialists, which is important when a team has no formal manager.
