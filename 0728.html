    <title>Var Let and Const in Javascript</title>

      While studying JavaScript, I have seen three ways to declare variables, namely var, let and const. In this article I will try to summarize the differences between these assignment operators.

      To really understand the difference between var, let and const, we need to understand the following concepts:
<ul>
<li>The declaration of a variable</li>
  <li>Initializing a variable</li>
    <li>Scope of visibility</li>
      <li>The mechanism of hoisting ("raising")</li>
    </ul>
Declaring a Variable
Declaring a variable is the process of introducing a new definition into a program or, to be more precise, into its scope. In JavaScript, variables are initially undefined when we declare the keyword var (this is automatically done by the interpreter).
