      React is a JavaScript library that is used to create a user interface. React was created by Facebook, and the first release of the library saw the light in March 2013. Originally React was intended for the web, for creating websites, but later there was React Native platform, which was already designed for mobile devices. React is an ideal tool for creating scalable web applications (in this case we are talking about the frontend). React is relatively easy to learn, has a clear and concise syntax. Today I will talk about two main features of React: JSX and Virtual DOM.
JSX
JavaScript XML special syntax created by Facebook. JSX is a combination of JavaScript and XML code and provides a simple and intuitive way to define visual interface code. Despite being simple and intuitive, the browser does not understand such code. It needs either HTML or Javascript. Therefore, there is a compiler between the code written by the developer and the code that comes in the browser. We are talking in this case about Babel. It transforms a fashionable and beautiful JSX into a boring and long Javascript in the old ES5 notation. Babel does this so quickly that when you run your application in developer mode, it does it on the fly and you can debug the code by looking at the React code you wrote and the result of the code that came out after processing it Babel
Virtual DOM
The entire structure of a web page is presented using DOM (Document Object Model), an organization of html elements with which we can manipulate, modify, delete or add new elements. The JavaScript language is used to interact with DOM. However, when we try to manipulate html elements with JavaScript, we may encounter performance degradation, especially when changing a large number of elements. And the operations on the elements may take some time, which will inevitably affect the user experience. However, if we worked from js code with JavaScript objects, the operations would be faster. To solve the performance problem, the virtual DOM concept has appeared. Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of ordinary DOM. And the distinctive feature of React is that this library works with virtual DOM, not ordinary DOM. If an application needs to know about the state of elements, the virtual DOM is accessed.
If it is necessary to change the elements of the web page, the changes are first made in the virtual DOM. Then the new virtual DOM state is compared to the current state. And if these states are different, React finds the minimum number of manipulations that are necessary before updating the real DOM to the new state and produces them.
As a result, such a scheme of interaction with web page elements works much faster and more efficiently than if we worked from JavaScript with DOM directly.
Thats all for part 1, to be continued
